          You can read this article on Medium <a href="https://blog.framer.com/prototyping-for-the-web-with-framer-c619925272d5">here.</a> Framer is a really powerful tool that can prototype anything you can think of but if you take a look at Framerâ€™s Gallery youâ€™ll quickly notice something:

          Nearly every example of a Framer prototype is a mobile app.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          Out of their 54 examples, 48 of them are apps, 4 for Apple Watch, 1 for iPad and 1 for Apple TV. Is Framer even meant for â€˜traditionalâ€™ web/desktop design?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          <span>Absolutely.</span>
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          At IBM Design most of my designs are made for enterprise desktop web applications. Most designers I work with use Sketch (including myself). These Sketch files are then prototyped using a tool like InVision or recreated and prototyped in code. As a front end developer on a design team I have a unique position where I both design and code prototypes.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          After learning the basics of Framer, I decided to add it to my workflow and itâ€™s really improved my design process. The single most powerful part is being able to import a static Sketch file into Framer and turn it into a realistic, interactive prototype in a relatively short amount of time.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          With this, I donâ€™t have to spend valuable time in the beginning of the process recreating designs in code. I can get ideas in front of stakeholders & users much faster. I can save coding for later on when the project is more solidified.

          And use Framer to create an interactive prototype
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          After using Framer for a few months hereâ€™s some things Iâ€™ve learned:
        </p>
        </br>
        <h4 class="web__item-par-heading">
          Plan and scope your prototypes
        </h4>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          Before I start a project, I decide a few things:
          </br></br>
          What am I trying to accomplish?
          </br></br>
          Whether the prototype is for user testing or getting an idea conceptualized, whatâ€™s the minimum amount of work needed to get my idea across or to gain insight from testing? Iâ€™m not just being lazy ðŸ˜‰, this helps decide the necessary interactions, animations and screens that are needed.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          The more time you spend on your design the more you become attached. The more attached, the less likely you are to make the necessary changes.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          Letâ€™s use the prototype above as an example. I was working on a new project and I wanted to explore what a card based layout with â€˜shufflingâ€™ animations in between states would look like. I sketched out the basic idea I wanted to make and used that as my starting point.
        </p>
        <img class="screen__wide" src="../../img/web-framer-4.jpeg" alt="">
        <p class="web__item-text centered">
          I generally sketch before I use Sketch
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          If you <a href="http://share.framerjs.com/yzb4l8t61m2w/" target="_blank">take a look</a> at the finished prototype, only the first card is clickable in each step. There is no way to go back, no hover states, the content in the last screen isnâ€™t complete, and itâ€™s not nearly pixel perfect. None of those were necessary to get my idea across so I didnâ€™t spend time including them. Framer can do just about anything, but that doesnâ€™t mean you should try to do everything in your prototype.

        </h4>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          You can use the ViewController Sketch plugin to create UI flows right in Sketch. Quickly turn your designs into clickable prototypes without having to write code.

        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          This is great for presenting your work to stakeholders and is really quite simple to do. Instead of walking through a Sketch file with a dozen artboards or a .pdf, you can present an interactive prototype or share your hosted Framer project URL.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          Depending on what Iâ€™m trying to accomplish I may end up writing some code for things like hover effects, animations and text inputs for an added touch of realism and interactivity. Again, as a designer, decide whatâ€™s necessary to get your idea across and implement appropriately.

          Microinteractions
        </h4>
        <img class="screen__wide" src="../../img/web-framer-7.gif" alt="">
        <p class="web__item-text">
          I think thereâ€™s a few reasons that mobile prototyping is really popular with Framer, one of them being microinteractions seem to much more commonplace on mobile. But it doesnâ€™t have to be that way! I think as designers for the web can be better at making our work have more motion and Framer is really good at this.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          This is just a simple example of a quick interaction I made using a Sketch file a designer on my team had already made. Exploring interactions like this takes a matter of minutes.
        </p>
        </br>
        <h4 class="web__item-par-heading">
          Sure, but why not just code?
        </h4>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          As a front end developer, a lot of my projects will eventually end up with a coded prototype. I then use this prototype as a basis to write the front end code into the product, working along side engineering. So why not just code from the start?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          As I mentioned earlier, speed. I can quickly flesh out ideas that either I or another designer have already made by importing them from Sketch into Framer. Itâ€™s great for the early part of the design process where youâ€™re exploring ideas and implementing feedback quickly. I can move pretty fast in code, but Framer takes it to the next level.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          Another reason is freedom. The simple fact that all of my code written in Framer will be thrown away is actually kind of great. It allows me to try things I wouldnâ€™t otherwise and to be a bit more loose with my code. I can spend 15 minutes exploring an idea and then trash it without any remorse.

          Some tips & tricks
        </h4>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          You (or the designer youâ€™re working with) will probably have to set up Sketch files a bit differently.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Group your layers. Layers that are not in a group are ignored</li>
          <li>Avoid using spaces in your group names</li>
          <li>Hidden layers in Sketch are still imported, but their visibility will be set to false.</li>
          <li>Create simple, unique names for your artboards</li>
          <li>A minus (-) at the end of your artboard will exclude it from being imported into Framer</li>
        </ul>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          Flatten any layers in Sketch that will remain static. This will improve the loading time of your project, which is especially great when creating a heftier prototype. You can do this by adding an asterisk(*) to the end of the layer in Sketch.
        </p>
        <img class="screen__wide" src="../../img/web-framer-8.png" alt="">
        <p class="web__item-text">
          Itâ€™s worth spending some time with the designers on your team to go over how to setup Sketch files to best fit the workflow and what works best for the team.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          When you import a Sketch file into Framer, youâ€™ll see something like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            # Import file "design"
            sketch = Framer.Importer.load("imported/design@1x")
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          Use this snippet to reference layers directly. No more need to reference sketch file, you can just reference layers directly:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            Utils.globalLayers sketch
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          Use the â€˜Normal Cursorâ€™ snippet for a normal mouse pointer:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            document.body.style.cursor = "auto"
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          I import my designs at @2x and then scale them down, so theyâ€™re extra crisp. Note that this doesnâ€™t seem to get along with the ViewController module mentioned above.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            Framer.Device.contentScale = .5
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          Sketch and Framer use different default artboards/devices for the web. Sketch uses 1440x1024 while Framer uses 1440x900. I opt for 1440x900. Donâ€™t think youâ€™re restricted to 900 pixels for height though, you can easily create scrollable pages in Framer.
