				<p class="web__item-text">
In late November I was approached to join a new team that would be focusing on Container Orchestration technology, mainly Kubernetes. Oh, and they needed to launch the entire thing in 4 months. The two things I love most about being a designer are shipping product and learning new things, so I decided to join the team.</br>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          I was familiar with containers but I had never heard of Kubernetes, so I spent my first few weeks almost solely learning, reading and watching videos on the technology. Having coding experience definitely helped here. Being familiar with the terminal I was able to do things like create containers and deploy an app to a cluster without being overwhelmed. Thereâ€™s no better way to learn than by doing!
        </br></br>
        <h4 class="web__item-par-heading">Workshop</h4>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          Since we we're a brand new team the first thing we wanted to do was a Design Thinking Workshop. This allowed us to get everyone (VP, Marketing, Engineers, Product Manager, and Design) in a room together to begin defining our experience. Us designers are based in Austin, TX while the rest of the team is in Raleigh, NC, so it was also a good opportunity to put faces to Slack avatars.

        <p class="web__item-text">
          We had about a day and a half, and in that time we did Empathy Mapping, Scenario mapping (based on the CLI experience at the time), Need Statements, Writing Hills, and making an Experience Based Roadmap. In the research we did the week before we had tentatively decided on two main personas, Brad and Josh. In a nutshell, Brad was more repsonsible for the development of apps inside the cluster, while Josh's main concerns are more with the cluster itself.
        </p>

        <p class="web__item-text">
          <img class="workshop__photo" src="../../img/workshop-scenario.jpg" alt="">
          </br></br>
          Going through the Scenario Mapping helped everyone not just understand what a user is actually doing, but why they are, how they feel about it, and when they would do certain tasks. This was also a great time to pick the brains
          of our engineers to understand the architectural decisions they've made and if they truly align with user needs.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          Scenario mapping combined with empathy mapping allowed us as a team to view our users not just as job titles and techincal roles, but as real people with thoughts and feelings. Discussing what they say, do, think and feel humanizes our users and helps us understand their feelings.
        </p>

        <p class="web__item-text">
          After going through several of these design exercies we then wrote our hills. If you're not familiar with hills, you can read about them <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/keys/hills/" target="_blank">here</a>.
          In short, hills turn usersâ€™ needs into project goals, helping your team align around a common understanding of the intended outcomes to achieve.
          The three hills we decided on we're centered around Creating, Managing, and Deploying. These would act as our "North Star" in the coming months.

        <p class="web__item-text">
          1) Josh, a lead developer, can create a Kubernetes cluster and attach persistent storage for his developers to use. He has a clear understanding of cost during this process.
        </br></br>
        2) Josh can view the overall health of the nodes of the cluster. He can scale the nodes as well as update the version of Kubernetes.
        </br></br>
        3) Brad can access the cluster and add pod workloads. He can make claims against the attached storage.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p class="web__item-text">
          We then used the rest of the workshop to scope our "minimum delightful experience" based on the user journeys we had gone through. We got a rough idea of what we needed to accomplish in the next 3 months before our public beta release. Getting everyone on the same page and thinking about our users got us prepared for the work ahead.
        </p>

        <h4 class="web__item-par-heading">My Role</h4>
        <p class="web__item-text">This project really allowed me to use all my skills: visual design, user experience, prototyping and front end development. I led the UI design effort of our team of 4 people. My process generally went like this: Learn user needs with user research, sketch out some low-fidelity wireframes, use our <a href="http://carbondesignsystem.com/" target="_blank">component library</a> in Sketch to quickly create a high-fidelity UI, and then prototype with Framer or code. These assets would then be user tested with 3-5 people and I would take the feedback, iterate, and repeat.</p></br>
        <p class="web__item-text">Once we were confident with the overall direction of our designs, we would try to get in production code as quickly as possible. Having a strong background in front end development enabled me to communicate our design intent, contribute production code, and act as a sort of liasion for engineering to communicate technical limitations.</p>
      </br>
      <h4 class="web__item-par-heading">Solving the Getting Started problem</h4>
      <p class="web__item-text">One of our main goals in the beginning of this project was to allow a user to easily configure and create a Kubernetes cluster in our UI. Once we felt we had this experience to a point we were happy with, we moved onto our next problem. Something we consistently heard in user testing was, more or less, "Okay, I created my cluster...now what?".</p></br>
      <p class="web__item-text">One of the big problems we had to work around was the fact that it takes awhile for a cluster to be fully ready and usable (up to 45 minutes). We needed a way to let users be productive while this time passed. Using user research conducted by our wider team and the documentation that had been created by our content team, I began to sketch out a 'getting started' experience.</p>
      </br>
      <p class="web__item-text">I identified several key things a user could accomplish to start being productive. These ranged from installing the CLI, deploying a containerized application, adding a Bluemix service, adding IP addresses, and creating persistant storage. A key finding we had from previous user testing was that people wanted to know what the exact progress was during this 45 minute wait. Our inital experience did have this information, but it was tucked away in a tab, inside of a table row. The first thing I wanted to was to bring this information front and center. I also wanted to give users some explanation of what was going on, and all the things they can do with their cluster to be successful.</p>
      </br>
      <p class="web__item-text">I sketched out some initial concepts in an afternoon and then jumped into Sketch. My typical Sketch file ends up with like 30 artboards, as I work through the design.</p>
      </br>

      <img class="workshop__photo" src="../../img/getting-started-1.png" alt="">
      <img class="workshop__photo" src="../../img/getting-started-2.png" alt="">
      </br></br><p class="web__item-text">Once I was happy with the visual design and layout, I went into Framer and spent the afternoon showing how the interactions would work. I like to use Framer for rapid prototyping like this because I can import my Sketch artboards, and ideate pretty fast. At this point I'm not ready to commit to production code, and I am still feeling out how I want the interactions to look and feel.</p>
      </br></br>
      <img class="workshop__photo" src="../../img/gettingstarted-framer.gif" alt="">
      </br></br><p class="web__item-text">I then worked with our content writing team to flesh out the work and begin laying out all the content we have into our UI. I'm currently in the process of writing the front end production code and planning the analytics so we can see the results of the effort.</p>
      </br>
      <h4 class="web__item-par-heading">Assets</h4>
      <p class="web__item-content">Here's a few of the assets I ended up making throughout the entire process of designing our service. One of them was actually featured in the opening keynote of IBM's yearly conference. It's always a cool feeling to have your work shown in front of thousands of people ðŸ˜Ž </p>
