					I'm a product designer specializing in the cloud, containers and Kubernetes ecosystems. I have experience in freelancing, marketing agencies, large corporations and startups. I enjoy working at the intersection of design and engineering while meeting both organizational and user goals. I love the iterative process of talking to users, prototyping their needs and implementing those into production.				</p>

        <h2>IBM</h2>
        <h3>Product Designer</h3>
        <h4>January 2015 - November 2017 (2.9 years)</h4>
        <p>I went through IBM Design Bootcamp for three months at the IBM Design Studio in Austin, TX, where I learned the value of human centered design and design thinking while solving real problems on various products. Working on several projects allowed us all to branch out of our individual disciplines and learn the scope of the entire design process. I specialized in creating prototypes for user testing.</p>
      </br><p>Since completing Bootcamp I've been working on IBM's Cloud Platform. I've spent my time on two teams:</p>
    </br><h5>IBM Cloud Container Service</h5>
        <h3>Lead UI Designer</h3>
        <p>Led the team's visual and UI design effort while also focusing on user experience, user research, user testing, prototyping. Launched our Kubernetes service into public beta in 4 months. Worked with engineering to implement design’s layout and styling in a React.js environment.</p>
        <h5>IBM Cloud Growth</h5>
        <h3>Front End Developer</h3>
        <p>Focused on the “Discover, Try, Buy” experience of the product. Worked on projects that improved user experience and retention rates of registration, login, onboarding, account management, and purchasing. Worked with product management and engineering to become more data and test driven when making design decisions. Spent the majority of my time writing front end code in various microservices.</p>
      </br></br>
